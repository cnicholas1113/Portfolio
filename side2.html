            About my skills in Video Editing
        </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="p3">
            Video Editing has gone a long way in technology, 
            <br>
            IT has come from just putting pieces of a film together 
            <br>
            into adding sounds effects, while adding filters and 
            <br>
            adding captions or pictures into the film, I would like 
            <br>
            to be in this video editor as it advances  in time to time, 
            <br>
            I want to see it evolve and becoming something 
            <br>
            better than it is now. I canâ€™t  wait for my turn in editing history. 
            <br>
            My main purpose in film editor is just to 
            <br>
            edit videos, which is self explanatory, 
            <br>
            they also have to get their own equipment which is time and 
            <br>
            money consuming. They have to be patient because some jobs are very long.
