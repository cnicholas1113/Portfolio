            <br>
            It was pain and simple when Im using adobe Photoshop, 
            <br>
            A Photoshop is for creating editing images based on my artwork,
            <br>
            iadmit that im not that kind fof expert 
            <br>

            <br>
            that I cans till learning when im watching 
            <br>
            anykinds of tutorials when it comes to adobe Photoshop, 
            <br>
            I start liking it when I found out that this 
            <br>
            system can edit all of kinds images and videos that 
            <br>
            I see on internet now a days. I can finish all of the 
            <br>
            task when it comes of editing an image and making video editing. 
            <br>
